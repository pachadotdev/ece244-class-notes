## About ECE244 - Programming Fundamentals

This course provides a foundation in programming using an object-oriented programming language. Topics include classes and objects, inheritance,  basic data structures (lists, tree, hash tables, etc.), Big-O complexity analysis, and testing and debugging. The laboratory assignments emphasize the use of object-oriented programming constructs in the design and implementation of reasonably large programs.

## Pacha's notes

The notes are 100% adjusted to the class. In the snippets folder, I have included some (unofficial) code snippets with the same examples from the notes, that I use check if my code compiles.
