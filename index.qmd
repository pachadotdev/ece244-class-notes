## About ECE244 - Programming Fundamentals

This course provides a foundation in programming using an object-oriented programming language. Topics include classes and objects, inheritance,  basic data structures (lists, tree, hash tables, etc.), Big-O complexity analysis, and testing and debugging. The laboratory assignments emphasize the use of object-oriented programming constructs in the design and implementation of reasonably large programs.

## Pacha's notes

* The notes are 100% adjusted to the class.
* In the snippets folder, I have included some (unofficial) code snippets with the same examples from the notes, that I use to check if the code compiles.
* Some of the examples in the notes have small additions, such as `using namespace std;` or `#include <iostream>`, to make them compile.
* The diagrams are kinda ugly, my apologies! I'm not a graphic designer.
