## About ECE244 - Programming Fundamentals

This course provides a foundation in programming using an object-oriented programming language. Topics include classes and objects, inheritance,  basic data structures (lists, tree, hash tables, etc.), Big-O complexity analysis, and testing and debugging. The laboratory assignments emphasize the use of object-oriented programming constructs in the design and implementation of reasonably large programs.
