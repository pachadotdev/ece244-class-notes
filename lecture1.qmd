# Lecture 1 - Sept 7, 2023

## Summary

In this lecture, we discuss what we will learn in this course, motivate object-oriented programming, and how is the course planned/organized/managed.

## Motivation

We will learn about a programming paradigm (style/philosophy of programming)
called object-oriented programming using C++

## Why object-oriented programming?

* Modular code â€” divide code into independent pieces
* Reusable code
* Easily extend code
* Easier to maintain
* Easier to collaborate with large teams
* Popular programming paradigm

## Why C++?

* Generally C/C++ are more difficult as they are closer to the hardware
* Can manage memory
* Easier to learn other languages once you know C/C++
